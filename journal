- installing docker on windows 10, and then trying to get docker working from WSL Ubuntu 18.04
  on my windows 10 laptop
   after several attempts, found some articles on doing this, but all resulting in various failures
- getting python installed in WSL
   lot of packages nessarily need to be loaded in my WSL Ubuntu to compile app.py locally
   additional pakages for python3, etc., etc.

- got docker working from WSL (took 2 days to understand all this new technology)
   but things still failing, as guide to get docker WSL working recommended differnt way to mount c,d drives
   something in flask requires knowing about /mnt
   worked around this problem by creating symbolic links to c,d, but then docker started failing
   required legacy settings of docker , along with alternate symbolic links
- abandoning WSL as i couldn't be sure that problems i am seeing are due to my docker WSL or due to systems-puzzle (SPZ)
   remembering i had a old lenovo laptop running Ubuntu
- more time getting docker configures on Ubuntu laptop
- need to get flask tutorial going, as want to know if i am setting up docker properly. 
  Now looking at docker & flask tutorials. Tutorials on web seem similar to SPZ.
- tutorials working. wish i knew what all this Dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml is really doing.
- turning on debug on Flask, and running app.py locally, i finally see the query form on localhost in browser, 
   but crashes on submit of form, really long stacktrace, seems not connecting to database
- crash at submit of form, stacktrace pointing to commit(), still some issue with database

- using python logging to get some understanding of app flow. 
- found issue with port setting 80:8080 in docker-compose.yaml, this appears to be backward from tutorials
  setting of port 5001 in app.py (this settings really should be exernalized from running of app)
- how does the docker-compose run /bin/bash -c "import database; int_db()" work ? how does this continue with python app.py ?
  putting in some getpid() debug into the code, seems pid is same for the docker-compse run and the pyton app.py
  how is this ?  hmm. Why put this code into command line, seperately from app.py ?
- something failing as "database" not found .  works locally, but not in docker. 
  debugging this -- trying to get the docker-compose run to give me more info, any way to get an "ls" of the container dirctory ?
  doing docker down , to clean up docker, needs somthing more. ok, now have script start.sh to start from
  a clean docker .  docker prune.  docker build ?
  looking at what really is Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml and how the multiple container orchastration works

- redirect url failing, trying to debug.  redirct URL is : http://localhost%2Clocalhost:8080/success
  what is this garbage after the first localhost string ?
  something fishy with python redirect(url_for('success'))
  how to get python logging back from container ?
  also, need to figure our all of port mapping stuff to access db container from  python app runnying locally
  also, how to run python debugger to container
- ok, time to look at git diffs, and commit
